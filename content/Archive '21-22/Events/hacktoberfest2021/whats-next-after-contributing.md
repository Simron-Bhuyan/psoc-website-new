## SUMMARY

On 12th October, the **PSoc, IIIT-Bh** along with **GDSC IIIT-Bh** organized the event **"What's next after CONTRIBUTING.md? "** as a part of **"HacktoberFest 2021"** , specifically for all the Open Source enthusiasts and other students in general. The session was open to the public and approximately 60 peoples were in attendance.During the session, attendees asked their doubts, questions along with their opinion, thoughts, and suggestions about the session.

The session was hosted by **Saksham Gupta** and **[Kartikey Rawat](https://github.com/carrycooldude)** where they gave hands-on training on the following topics:

- Introduction to Open Source.
- Approach on targetting big projects like Tensorflow
- Networking with project managers.
- Details on "How to contribute to a project?"
- His experience in GSoC.

It started with the usual introduction and formalities. Then **Mr. Rawat** straight on jumped to the main topic of the event i.e Open Source contributions. He started with his very own contribution, to the **Tensorflow.js** repo and stressed the importance of communicating with project maintainers. Then he went on to give details about his contribution and some workings of Tensorflow.js. He also emphasized the importance of the quality of your contributions rather than the quantity. He then shared his experience with GSoC. At last, he answered the questions of the attendees and gave some career advice to the young students in attendance. The event ended with **Saksham** thanking the guest for gracing us with his presence and sharing his valuable insights into the Open Source world.
