- Firstly we will need an IDE. We recommend using [VSCode]((https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) for Web dev.
- Then install [nodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (npm is installed automatically along with nodeJS, in most cases). Ensure that you have correctly installed both by running these in command prompt/terminal : 
    - `node -v`
    - `npm -v` 

(following are not prerequisites, but more of recommendations, so that you have some good questions to ask in the session)
